  <div> <h2> C-Unit0</h2></div>
  
        Goal of Unit-0 is to make the flow work end to end.
        
        <div><h3>All the steps:</h3></div>
        - Open the Visual Studio solution file (ProjectName.sln file).
        <br>
        - Implement the function 'Sum'.
        <br>
        - Run all the tests.
        <br>
        - Test and Submit from this Project Tracker tool.
        <br><br>
        
        Each Project will have a tutorial like this one, which will give a breif overview of the Tasks you will be doing and sample codes.
        
        <div><h3>Open the solution file:</h3></div>
        Go to the directory where you saved and open the ProjectName.Sln file using Visual Studio 2013 express. You will see 2 projects, src and spec. Src project has the files which you need to code.
        
        <div><h3>Implement the function 'Sum':</h3></div>
        Write your code in the 'Sum' function stub in the files present in src->Source folder
        To pass sample inputs to your 'Sum' function and observe the output, Call the function from Main file which has a main function. It is recommended to test your functions only from here.
        
        <div><h3>Run all the tests:</h3></div>
        After you code your function stub, Run Tests from Test->Run->All Tests. It runs testcases of All problems in the project.
        It shows the list of test cases passed or failed, You can click on failed test cases and see in bottom left window where they failed or the Expected result.
        
        <div><h3>Test and Submit from Project Tracker tool:</h3></div>
        Once a problem has passed all tests related to it, go to the Project Tracker Tool, and then click on The Problem you just coded. (If the code you wrote isn't visible in the right window, do click on any other problem and click back on this problem), Now click on Test on the above. It takes some time for first time run.
        You will see Test Failed or Tests Passed Message. If failed go to VS2013 and code again correctly.
        Once all tests have been cleared, Click on Submit.
        
        <div><h3>Unable to submit?</h3></div>
        The purpose of this unit is find the problems in the end to end process of getting new units and submitting you code. It's common to hit problems in the process. Check the <a href="http://54.213.96.60/questions/">forum</a> for solutions.
