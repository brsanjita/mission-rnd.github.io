  <div> <h2> C-Unit2</h2></div>
  
        Goal of Unit-2 is to understand
        <br>
        - functions with variable number of arguments
        <br>
        - passing functions as arguments to other functions.
        <br>
        - type casting and type definition
        <br>
        - strings and memory

        The structure of the unit is it contains some lessons and exercises.
        <br>
        In lessons, you will update the test cases (spec) with expected output.
        <br>
        In exercises, you will update the function stubs (src) with functionality.
        <br>
        
        You need do these steps.
        <br>
        - Open the Visual Studio solution file (ProjectName.sln file).

        - Complete the lessons and excerices.
        <br>
        - Run all the tests.
        <br>
        - Test and Submit from this Project Tracker tool.

         <br>
         Lessons in files with prefix 'L0'
         <br>
         Spec files for lessons with prefix 'L0' and suffix 'Spec.cpp'
         <br>
         Excercises in files with prefix 'E0'
         <br><br>

         <br>
         - Instruction about how to complete this unit.
         <br>
         - Study links to read and watch related concepts, don't miss them.
         <br><br>
         
         Wish you a joyful coding...
